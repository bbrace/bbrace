"A compassionate observer, { brad brace } forges a personal aesthetic in these
12hr-images infused with blank-sadness and a sense of mystery. What makes them both
new and significant is the fact that he organizes its contents in sequences, applying
the principles of cinematographic montage to fixed images."

Immaculate Perception: to be happy in gazing: with dead will, free from the grip and
greed of selfishness -- cold and ashy-grey all over, but with intoxicated
moon-eyes... Extraordinary Rendition. Manifest Destiny. Abyssal Plain. Living Truth.
Sublime Madness. Autofictional Metanarrative. Sovetskoe Foto.

 You begin to sense the byshadows that stretch from the awe of global
 dominance. How the intersecting systems help pull us apart, leaving
 us vague, drained, docile, soft in our inner discourse, willing to be
 shaped, to be overwhelmed -- easy retreats, half beliefs. Works of art
 are complex formal interventions within discursive traditions and their
 myriad filiations. These interventions are defined precisely by their 
 incomparable capacity to trace the dynamics of historical process in 
 paradoxical gestures of simultaneously prognostic and mnemonic 
 temporalities.

> > > > Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994. A
`round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery from { brad
brace }. The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the
recognizable; it suspends identity, relations and history. This
discourse, far from determining the locus in which it speaks, is avoiding
the ground on which it could find support. It is trying to operate a
decentering that leaves no privilege to any center.


                       The 12-hour ISBN JPEG Project        
                       -----------------------------
                          began December 30, 1994


  Time-honoured, pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... 
a spectral, trajective alignment for the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist masks 
in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative metaphors for the everyday... 
A poetic reversibility of exclusive events: visual haiku...

        A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of imagery...  
genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact, collectable and compelling
convergence. The vernacular voluptuousness of the grey imminence: the art of making
the other disappear. Continual visual impact; an optical drumming, sculpted in
duration, on the endless present of the Net.

  An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and re-sequenced
over time...  ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The 12hr dialtone...

~ This interminable, relentless (online) sequence of imagery began in
earnest on December 30, 1994. The basic structure of the project has been
over thirty years in the making. While the specific sequence of
photographs has been presently orchestrated for many years` worth of
12-hour postings, I will undoubtedly be tempted to tweak the ongoing
publication with additional new interjected imagery. Each 12-hour image
is like the turning of a page; providing ample time for reflection,
interruption, and assimilation.

~ The sites listed above also contain information on other cultural
projects and sources.

~ A very low-volume, moderated mailing list for announcements and occasional
commentary related to this project has been established. To subscribe to 12-list,
simply send a message with the word "subscribe" in the Subject: field to
12-list-requestATeskimoDOTcom

 	 The image was to make nothing visible but their connection with
 	 one another by space and air, yet each surrounded by the unique
 	 aura that disengages every deeply seen image from the world of
 	 irrelevant relationships and calls forth a tremor of
 	 astonishment at its fateful necessity. Thus from artworks of
 	 dead masters, over-life-size strangeness whose names we do not
 	 know and do not wish to know, look out at us enigmatically as
 	 symbols of all being.

 Big Grey Bricks: This project also serves as a rehearsal for its
 culmination as a series of offset-printed volumes: each 800+ full-bleed
 pages (5x8"_300lpi), where the full integrated rhythm of
 greyscale-sequence can be more intricately resolved. I'd provide all
 design, prepress and production. The tonality of the imagery is
 important; these 12hr-jpegs scanned from film-prints are quick 
 approximations for an institutionally unsupported outcome.

 -- 

This project remains untainted by corrupt corporate and glib government
art-subsidies. Some opportunities still exist for financially assisting the
publication of editions of large (33x46") prints; perhaps (Iris giclees) 
inkjet duotones or extended-black quadtones with diasec on dibond mount.

Other supporters receive rare copies of the first three web-offset printed
ISBN-Books. Contributions and requests for 12hr-email-subscriptions, 
can also be made at http://bradbrace.net/buy-into.html, 
or by mailed cheque/check: $5/mo $50/yr. Art-institutions must pay $12K 
for each image retained longer than 12 hours. Their false historical assets 
liquidated, they must also be repurposed as vital community centers.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: No one and nothing. For over 20 years I've been
posting this series of imagery online with out a nickel of support or
word of critical consideration. More proof of corrupt cultural agency
that excludes all but the validated insider sycophants. World (art)history 
is but a shuffled pack of lies. Here is, in total 40+ years' photo-artwork 
that only thrives beyond institutional tyranny. The tables turn! Avoid
downed power lines! Defund incestuous gov't arts agencies.

"You live in what we call the reality-based community. But 
that's not the way the world really works anymore. We're an empire now, 
and when we act, we create our own reality... we're history's actors... 
and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do."
